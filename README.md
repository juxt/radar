# Intro

Technology radars can be useful. I respect the effort ThoughtWorks has gone to in producing theirs, and I believe that other companies should build their own too, so that we can all make better informed decisions on what tech to use.

The ThoughtWorks technology radar is very broad, with blips for techs and processes from across the industry. At JUXT we decided to make a Clojure only one. Since it's much finer grained, it ought to be useful.

It's crucial to note that a technology radar is _subjective_, based on the collective subjective experiences of those that built the radar. We welcome feedback and debate to make it better next time.

# How we built it

It's currently a work in progress, but check out [foo.svg](https://github.com/juxt/radar/blob/master/foo.svg). We built it with `thi.ng/geom`.
